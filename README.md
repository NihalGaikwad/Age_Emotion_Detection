# Age_Emotion_Detection

This project involves developing a machine learning model to detect a personâ€™s age and emotional state from a voice note. By extracting vocal features, the system analyzes the characteristics of speech to provide accurate predictions for both age and emotion.
## Features  
- Extracts meaningful vocal features such as MFCCs, pitch, and energy for model input.
- Trains regression models to predict age from voice recordings.
- Implements classification models to detect emotional states (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
- Focuses on accurate predictions without GUI development, highlighting functionality.

# Age Detection using Fine-Tuned CNN (VGGFace)  

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically **VGGFace**, to perform age detection on the **IMDB-WIKI** dataset.  

## Features  
- Leverages transfer learning to adapt VGGFace for age detection tasks.  
- Prepares the IMDB-WIKI dataset for effective training and testing.  
- Focuses on functionality and accuracy without the use of a GUI.  
- Implements custom layers for model optimization.
